# MCP Cloud Compliance

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for AWS cloud compliance auditing.

## Project Goal

This MCP server aims to automate cloud compliance reporting for major security frameworks including SOC2, NIST, and PCI-DSS. Instead of manually gathering evidence and checking hundreds of controls across your AWS infrastructure, you'll be able to have a conversation with Claude to generate comprehensive compliance reports. 

The vision is to transform compliance auditing from a manual, time-consuming process into an intelligent, conversational experience where you can ask questions like:
- "Generate a SOC2 Type II report for our AWS infrastructure"
- "Check our NIST 800-53 compliance status"
- "Are we PCI-DSS compliant for our payment processing environment?"
- "Show me all non-compliant resources in production"

Currently, the project supports basic S3 bucket compliance checks, with plans to expand to full AWS service coverage and automated report generation.

## Prerequisites
- Java 21 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- AWS credentials configured

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/uprightsleepy/mcp-cloud-compliance.git
cd mcp-cloud-compliance

# Build the project
mvn clean package
```

## Running the MCP Server

### Option 1: Using Maven
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Option 2: Using the JAR
```bash
java -jar target/cloud-compliance-mcp-0.1.0.jar
```

## Configuring Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude configuration file:

**macOS/Linux:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloud-compliance": {
      "command": "java",
      "args": ["-jar", "/absolute/path/to/mcp-cloud-compliance/target/cloud-compliance-mcp-0.1.0.jar"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop and look for the ðŸ”¨ icon to confirm the server is connected.

## Running Tests
